      <p>If you've seen Jurassic Park, this guy should look familiar to you!
        This is Mr. DNA, and he is responsible for making you, you.
        If you didn't know DNA stands for <b><u>D</b></u>eoxyribo<b><u>N</b></u>ucleic <b><u>A</u></b>cid, and is the molecule that contains the genetic code of all living organisms.
        This includes animals, plants, protists, archaea and even bacteria.
        <br><br>
        DNA has a double helix shape, which is like a ladder twisted into a spiral. Each step of this ladder structure is made of by a pair of molecules which are called nucleotides.
        These nucleotides are composed of Adenine(A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G). These four nucleotides pair with each other and code for an amino acid, which is what we are going to focus on below!

          <p>Amino acids are composed of three nucleotides, which is referred to as a codon. This codon is transcripted into RNA (Ribonucleic Acid), and then 
            translated into its respective amino acid. There are a total of 20 amino acids that can be translated numerous ways from that first strand of DNA we started with.</p>
